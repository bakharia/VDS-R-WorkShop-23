# VDS-R-WorkShop-23

Hi, Thank you for participating in the Introduction to R and Vizualisation workshop. We have used a similar code (acceptable to Google Colab since all codes of R Studio do not always work on Colab) as R studio

We have also included some elemenatary challenges for your practice. You can access them from the challenges folder above.

You can also find the original code in the form of qmd files: *Syntax.qmd*, *Survey.qmd*, *Vizualizations.qmd*
