Anything following a \"\\#\" symbol on a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by the R interpreter.\n\nData types: R has a number of built-in data types, including character strings, integers, and floating-point numbers. R also has a special data type called a \"vector\" that can be used to store a sequence of values.\n\nVariables: Variables are used to store values in R. Variables are memory locations that store values during the execution of a computer program. To define a variable in R, we use the reverse-arrow(\\<-) operator.\n\nOperators: R has a number of operators that can be used to perform calculations and compare values. These include arithmetic operators such as \"+\", \"-\", \"\\*\", and\"/\", and logical operators such as\"==\" (equal to) and \"!=\" (not equal to).\n\nFunctions: Functions are used to perform specific tasks in R. To call a function, you use the function name followed by parentheses.\n\n```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}\nif (!require(pacman)) install.packages(\"pacman\")\n\npacman::p_load(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n\n```{r}\ndf <- read.csv(\"hotel_bookings.csv\")\nhead(df)\n```\n\n```{r}\nsummary(df)\n```\n\n```{r}\nstr(df)\n```\n\n```{r}\ndf %>%\n  group_by(hotel) %>%\n  count()\n```\n\n```{r}\ndf %>%\n  group_by(hotel) %>%\n  count() %>%\n  rename(\"Number of Bookings\" = \"n\")\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Syntax.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"Syntax","author":"Ravina Banze"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
